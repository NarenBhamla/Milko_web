    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 30/09/2025</p>
    <p>Digital Rocketships (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, or ‚Äúus‚Äù) operates the Milko and Milko Biz mobile applications (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù).  
    This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our App.</p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> With your explicit permission, Milko may access your phone‚Äôs contact list (<code>READ_CONTACTS</code>) to fetch and securely store your customers‚Äô phone numbers.  
        This allows you to add contacts quickly without manual typing. All contact information is stored securely and used solely to provide Milko services.  
        We do not share or sell your contacts to any third parties. You can revoke this permission at any time from your device settings.</li>

        <li><strong>Profile Photos & Media:</strong> With your permission, Milko may access your device images (<code>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES</code>) and camera (<code>CAMERA</code>) to let you upload profile pictures or other app-related images.  
        Images are used only within the app and stored securely.</li>

        <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> With your consent, Milko may access your device location using <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> (precise) and <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code> (approximate).  
        This is used to auto-fill delivery addresses, provide location-based services, and improve app functionality.</li>

        <li><strong>Phone Calls:</strong> If you grant permission (<code>CALL_PHONE</code>), Milko may allow direct calls to your customers.  
        This permission is optional and can be revoked anytime from device settings.</li>

        <li><strong>Session Recordings, Heatmaps & Analytics:</strong> Milko uses <strong>Microsoft Clarity SDK</strong> to collect anonymized session replay data, heatmaps, and analytics.  
        This helps us understand how users interact with the app, improve UI/UX, and identify performance issues.  
        Microsoft Clarity may collect non-personal usage data as per their <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.  
        No sensitive personal information (passwords, payment data, or contacts) is collected by Clarity.</li>

        <li><strong>Crash & Performance Data:</strong> To help us improve stability and performance.</li>

        <li><strong>Personal Details:</strong> Information you provide, such as your name, phone number, and email address. These details are used solely to create and manage your account, process orders, and communicate with you regarding Milko services.</li>

        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Screens visited, buttons clicked, navigation patterns, and interactions within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and improve the app‚Äôs features and ensure a smooth, personalized experience.</li>
        <li>To allow quick addition of customers from your contacts securely, with your permission.</li>
        <li>To upload and manage profile photos safely within the app.</li>
        <li>To auto-fill delivery addresses and provide location-based services.</li>
        <li>To allow optional calls to customers (if you grant permission).</li>
        <li>To analyze app usage patterns, optimize UI/UX, fix bugs, and improve performance through Microsoft Clarity analytics.</li>
        <li>To send important notifications, updates, and order information.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect rights, property, and safety.</li>
    </ul>
